- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I found this to be a helpful code to figure out how encapsulation works because I had to use it so much, andit also gave me a better understanding of making and using lots of different methods and functions in different files. The instructions for this assignment were very helpful, and I felt like following along and figure out how to fulfill the requirements was a good learning method. I had a harder time once I started working in the Train class because I was confused about the purpose of the accessors and also because it involved using all of the classes together instead of just one or two, but I feel like I have a much better idea of how to do something like that now.
